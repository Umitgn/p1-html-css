<h1>HTML fundemantals</h1>
<h2>what is HTML?</h2>
<p>Hypertext markup language. It is the language that web browsers read to build a web page.
    It acts as a blueprint to display data on a user screen. This is the basic building block of
    the web. Every page on the Internet is just HTML at its core.</p>
    <h3>What are HTML-Elements?</h3>
    <p>Elements are what we use to tell the browser how we want the data supplied to be displayed</p>
    <h4>What is a tag?</h4></h4>
    <p>An element consists of an opening and closing tag. The data supplied between the tags will
        be displayed per the instructions of the element.</p>
    <p class="how" >How does the browser use HTML to create what I
        see?</p>
        <p>The browser reads and interprets the HTML file to understand how the developer intended
            the data to appear on the screen</p>
            <p>What are the basic HTML-Elements?</p>
            <p>The elements we learned about were html, head, body, p, span, div, and h1-h6</p>
            
 <p>More Elements
    A-tag</p>
    <p>The a anchor element, allows us to create links to other web pages (or even to other
        areas within our own web page). You will always see the a element used with
        the href attribute to tell the browser what address you want the link to point to.</p>

        <img src="img/screenshot.png" alt="foto van een element">
       <p>Img-tag</p>
       <p>This element will display an image on the screen. It will always have an src attribute which
        points to the address of the image to be displayed. NOTE: img tags can be self-closing, as in
        they do not need two tags. Simply put the / before the closing bracket in the first tag:
